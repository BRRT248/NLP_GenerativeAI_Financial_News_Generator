    "This project demonstrates the use of a pretrained GPT-2 language model (`distilgpt2`) to generate synthetic financial news headlines from a user-provided prompt.\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a pretrained small GPT-2 model to generate financial news-style text completions based on input prompts such as `\"Stock market reacts to\"`. This demonstrates generative AI's potential for content creation in financial domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "A small set of example financial headlines (saved in `financial_headlines.txt`) was prepared as prompt examples. No fine-tuning was performed on this dataset; the pretrained model is used as-is for generation.\n",
